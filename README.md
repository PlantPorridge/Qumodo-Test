## With More Time
1. Split app.component.ts into smaller parts:
   * Move class definitions to their own files.
   * Move the form and grid into seperate components.
   * Move the api code to it's own service
   * Bundle the form component, grid component and api code into a Feature Module for better organisation and improved deployment.
   * Move the pagination control into it's own component and add it into a Shared Module for easier repeat use.
